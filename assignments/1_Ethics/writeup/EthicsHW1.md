I think that you should first tell you boss, their choices should influence what your next step should be. 
If they try and fix the problem, taking the problem by waiting the six months and finding a solution then that is the end of the
problem. If they don't fix the problem and continue with the scheduled release that is when you should go to the press or a 
consumer watchdog. I would go to the press because they would most likely have the biggest impact on the companies decision.
The final goal is to stop the production so that the problem can be fixed and danger to the consumer can be avoided. If the
company refuses to delay the release and possibly cause harm to the consumers you should do whatever you can to stop the release.
I you do nothing you are partly responsible for the outcome, you are not solely to blame but choosing not to take any actions is
still a decision that is your responsibility. The purpose of ethics is to influence your decisions to arrive at the best moral 
outcome. every situation is different and such every situation requires a different set of ethics that should be followed. every
person has different moral guidelines that they should follow, and the final goal should always be to avoid harming as many 
people as possible. It is almost impossible to say what the best steps to take in any situation as every situation is different
and every person has different morals.
