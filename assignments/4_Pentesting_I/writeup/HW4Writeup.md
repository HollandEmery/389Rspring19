## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 

The flag I found was CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}, the Input is used to find this was 
1 && cd home && cat flag.txt.  I figured this out by realizing if I concatenated commands in the domain search it would run the
commands after the domain.  I first looked at the contents in the directory and changed the directory to home and found the file
flag.txt I print the contents and found the flag. One way that this cound be avoided is including the entire text field in the
domain ping.

### Part 2 (60 pts)

The python code I wrote allows the user to enter one of 4 commands, help, shell, pull, and quit. quit exits the program and help
prints the commands. pull takes in 2 files pull <remote-path> <local-path> and copies the file in the remote path into the
local path. the last command shell, opens up a shell that allows the user to run commands on the local path, while in the shell
exit will exit.
