## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

There are multiple ways that someone could get someone's mother's maiden name, if you are able to get into a position where she
thinks you work for her bank or any service that has an online service you could say you need to confirm a security question
and use that to ask for her mothers maiden name or any other semi-personal information.  a lot of the information could be
gained by having a conversation, It would be fairly easy to figure out the browser that she used by recommending a chrome
extension and recording her respose.  The city she was born in could be found by asking where she is from, most people willingly
give up information about where they are from so that should not be much of a problem. The name of her first pet could be found
by either asking her to verify a security question like her maiden name or by just steering a conversation to pets when it would
likely be said naturaly. The hardest information to figure out would be her pin number this could be found by guessing common
pins like her birthday or year or 1234 and similar guesses but the only way to reliably get her pin would be to pretend to be
from her bank and ask for it or to watch her input it at a cash register or atm.

### Part 2 (60 pts)

The first vulnerability is weak passwords, any password that is to simple especially ones that are included in a wordfile such
as rockyou should not be used and personal information should be avoided. This is a simple fix to a vulnerability because a 
more complex password is harder to crack.  Another vulnerability is low security on the server, a firewall would help protect
against attacks and provide increased security. Another solution that would increase security is to put a limit on the number 
of guesses when logging into the server, if after five or ten incorrect guesses the server locks you out until yuo reset your
password it would be almost impossible to gain access to the server with a brute force attempt.
